1. Enable ssh in settings (Raspberry Pi Configuration)
2. Add a file called lusio.desktop to /home/pi/.config/autostart/ with contents:
	[Desktop Entry]
	Name=Lusio
	Type=Application
	Exec=sudo /usr/bin/python3 /home/pi/lusio/lusio.py
** Note that we execute with sudo.  This is because we run a flask server on port 80 for a web controller.  Running services using ports below 1024 requires root priveleges.

3. Disable screen blanking:
	sudo apt install xscreensaver

	This may take a few minutes.

Once this has been installed, you can find the screensaver application under the Preferences option on the main desktop menu. This provides many options for setting up the screensaver, or disabling it completely.

4. Clone https://github.com/agillgilla/lusio.git into /home/pi/lusio/
5. Install required packages with pip3:
	pip3 install python-vlc
	pip3 install omxplayer-wrapper
	pip3 install pickledb
	pip3 install flask
** Make sure to install these packages as the sudo user (run sudo su first)

6. Disable HDMI-CEC because the Pi breaks it (at least on our Samsung TV):
   Add the following lines to /boot/config/txt:

       hdmi_ignore_cec_init=1
       hdmi_ignore_cec=1
